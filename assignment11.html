/*Certainly! Here's an example of an array of objects in JavaScript with at least 10 objects.
 Each object has properties like name, age, and group. You can use this array to apply grouping
  based on the group property:

javascript
Copy code
let arrayOfObjects = [
  { name: 'John', age: 25, group: 'A' },
  { name: 'Alice', age: 30, group: 'B' },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 22, group: 'A' },
  { name: 'Charlie', age: 28, group: 'B' },
  { name: 'Diana', age: 35, group: 'C' },
  { name: 'Eva', age: 27, group: 'A' },
  { name: 'Frank', age: 32, group: 'C' },
  { name: 'Grace', age: 29, group: 'B' },
  { name: 'Henry', age: 31, group: 'A' },
  { name: 'Ivy', age: 26, group: 'C' }
];

you have to count the number of person who are lying in Group A*/
